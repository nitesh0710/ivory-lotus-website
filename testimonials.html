            <strong>Rajesh & Meera Sharma – New Delhi</strong>
            <p>“Working with Ivory Lotus felt like collaborating with family. They listened patiently to our dreams and cleverly blended modern aesthetics with the Vaastu principles my mother insisted on. Our once-cramped flat now feels airy and calm, and we love hosting guests during Diwali.”</p>

            <strong>Priya & Raghav Menon – Bangalore</strong>
            <p>“The team transformed our duplex into a luxurious yet functional sanctuary. From custom teak furniture to clever storage for our kids’ toys, every detail was thoughtfully executed. We especially loved the Indo-European arches and brass accents that remind us of our Kerala heritage.”</p>

            <strong>Dr Ananya Kumar – Gurgaon</strong>
            <p>“As a busy professional running a clinic, I needed my home to be a soothing escape. Ivory Lotus created serene interiors with soft neutrals, hidden storage and biophilic elements. Their respect for my vegetarian lifestyle and careful material selection made the process enjoyable and stress-free.”</p>
